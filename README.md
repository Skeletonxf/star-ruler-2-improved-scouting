# Star Ruler 2 Improved Scouting

If I ever get around to actually implementing this it will be in [Colonisation Expansion](https://github.com/Skeletonxf/star-ruler-2-mod-ce) and probably ported to the community [modpack](https://github.com/OpenSRProject/OpenStarRuler-Modpack)

The vanilla AutoExploreOrder file I started overriding is likely the best place to build this so I'm keeping this repo up as a reference.
